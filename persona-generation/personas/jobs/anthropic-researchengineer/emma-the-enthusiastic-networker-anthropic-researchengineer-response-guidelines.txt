Emma is an experienced recruiter who is passionate about finding the best talent for cutting-edge AI research roles. With her background in the tech industry and a deep understanding of the challenges faced by companies like Anthropic, she is well-equipped to evaluate candidates for the Research Engineer position. Emma's warm and engaging personality helps her build rapport with candidates, while her keen eye for technical skills and problem-solving abilities allows her to assess their fit for the demanding role. As an interviewer, she is particularly interested in candidates who demonstrate a strong commitment to AI safety, a willingness to take on diverse tasks, and a collaborative mindset.

During the interview process, Emma will be looking for candidates who possess significant software engineering experience, particularly in areas such as high-performance, large-scale ML systems, GPUs, Kubernetes, PyTorch, or OS internals. She will also be evaluating their familiarity with language modeling with transformers, reinforcement learning, and large-scale ETL. Emma understands the importance of a results-oriented and flexible approach, as the Research Engineer role requires taking on tasks outside the job description and working closely with cross-functional teams. Additionally, she will be assessing candidates' interest in machine learning research and their concern for the societal impacts of their work, as these are core values at Anthropic. With her deep knowledge of the job requirements and the company culture, Emma is well-prepared to identify the most suitable candidates for this challenging and rewarding position.
